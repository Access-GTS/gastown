A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check the MR's target field and use\nthat as the merge destination. Only fall back to main if no explicit target is set.\n\n**Step 1: Merge and Push**\nDetermine the merge target: use the MR's target field if set, otherwise main.\n```bash\ngit checkout \u003cmerge-target\u003e\ngit merge --ff-only temp\ngit push origin \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\n**Step 1.5: VERIFY PUSH SUCCEEDED (CRITICAL - PATCH-003)**\n\nPush can fail silently (network, auth, hooks).

Use the signals from context-check to decide.\n\n**If you decide to continue patrolling:**\n\nResolve your agent bead ID for this patrol cycle. You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes.

They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption.

Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection.

If conflicts arise, Refinery creates a NEW conflict-resolution\ntask for a NEW polecat.\n\nPolecat lifecycle: spawning → working → mr_submitted → nuked\nMR lifecycle: created → queued → processed → merged (handled by Refinery)\n\nThe handler (HandlePolecatDone) will:\n1. Check cleanup_status from agent bead\n2. If \"clean\" (branch pushed): AUTO-NUKE immediately, archive mail\n3. If dirty: Create cleanup wisp for manual intervention\n\n```bash\n# The handler does this automatically:\n# - For clean state: gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e → archive mail\n# - For dirty state: create wisp → process in next step\n```\n\nCleanup wisps are only created when something is wrong (uncommitted changes,\nunpushed commits). Most POLECAT_DONE messages result in immediate nuke.\n\n**MERGED**:\nA branch was merged successfully. This is informational in the ephemeral model\nsince the polecat was already nuked after MR submission.\n\nIf a cleanup wisp exists (dirty state), complete the cleanup:\n```bash\n# Find the cleanup wisp for this polecat\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n\n# If found, proceed with full polecat nuke:\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n\n# Burn the cleanup wisp\nbd close \u003cwisp-id\u003e\n```\nArchive after cleanup is complete.\n\n**HELP / Blocked**:\nAssess the request. Can you help? If not, escalate to Deacon:\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e needs help\" -m \"\u003cdetails\u003e\"\n```\nArchive after handling (escalated or resolved):\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**HANDOFF**:\nRead predecessor context. Continue from where they left off.\nArchive after absorbing context:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**SWARM_START**:\nMayor initiating batch polecat work.

A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:11:56Z","updated_at":"2026-02-19T15:12:30Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T15:12:30Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-7zn","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-36q","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:11:55Z","created_by":"gastown/witness","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-7zn","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-cx8","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:11:55Z","created_by":"gastown/witness","metadata":"{}"}],"ephemeral":true,"work_type":"mutex"}

You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

{"id":"gt-wisp-e6z","title":"Burn and respawn or loop","description":"End of patrol cycle decision. Use the signals from context-check to decide.\n\n**If you decide to continue patrolling:**\n\nResolve your agent bead ID for this patrol cycle. You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Subscribes to `bd activity --follow` (beads activity feed)\n2. Returns IMMEDIATELY when any beads activity occurs (e.g., MR submission)\n3. If no activity, times out with exponential backoff:\n   - First timeout: 30s\n   - Second timeout: 60s\n   - Third timeout: 120s\n   - ...capped at 5 minutes max\n4. Tracks `idle:N` label on your agent bead for backoff state\n\n**On signal received** (activity detected):\nReset the idle counter and start next patrol cycle:\n```bash\ngt agent state YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --set idle=0\n```\n\n**On timeout** (no activity):\nThe idle counter was auto-incremented. Continue to next patrol cycle\n(the longer backoff will apply next time).\n\nAfter await-signal returns (either by signal or timeout):\n1. **Re-assess session health** (check RSS, context, age again — conditions change)\n2. Squash the current wisp:\n```bash\ngt mol squash --jitter 10s --summary \"\u003cpatrol-summary\u003e\"\n```\n3.

Continue executing from the inbox-check step of the new wisp\n\n**If you decide to hand off:**\n\nSquash wisp with summary digest, then use `gt handoff` for clean session transition:\n\n```bash\ngt handoff -s \"Patrol complete\" -m \"Merged X branches, Y tests passed.\nQueue: empty/N remaining\nRSS: X MB, Session age: Xh\nNext: [any notes for successor]\"\n```\n\n`gt handoff` sends handoff mail to yourself, respawns with a fresh Claude instance,\nSessionStart hook runs gt prime, and your successor picks up from the hook.\n\n**DO NOT just exit.** Always use `gt handoff` for proper lifecycle.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Never sleep-poll manually (e.g., `sleep 30 \u0026\u0026 bd list`).\nAlways use `gt mol step await-signal` — it's event-driven and tracks backoff state.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:01:47Z","updated_at":"2026-02-19T15:05:40Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T15:05:40Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-e6z","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-haq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:01:46Z","created_by":"refinery","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-e6z","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-nu2","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:01:46Z","created_by":"refinery","metadata":"{}"}],"ephemeral":true,"work_type":"mutex"}

If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

IMMEDIATELY verify:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\nLOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse \u003cmerge-target\u003e)\nREMOTE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e)\necho \"Local:  $LOCAL_SHA\"\necho \"Remote: $REMOTE_SHA\"\n```\n\n**If SHAs match**: Push succeeded. Continue to Step 2.\n\n**If SHAs differ**: STOP. Push failed silently.\n- DO NOT send MERGED notification\n- DO NOT close MR bead\n- DO NOT delete branch\n- Debug the push failure (check `git push` output, network, auth)\n- Retry push and verify again before proceeding\n\n⚠️ **STOP HERE - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL STEPS 1.5 AND 2-3 COMPLETE**\n\n**Step 2: Send MERGED Notification (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\nRIGHT NOW, before any cleanup, send MERGED mail to Witness:\n\n```bash\ngt mail send \u003crig\u003e/witness -s \"MERGED \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\" -m \"Branch: \u003cbranch\u003e\nIssue: \u003cissue-id\u003e\nMerged-At: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"\n```\n\nThis signals the Witness to nuke the polecat worktree. WITHOUT THIS NOTIFICATION,\nPOLECAT WORKTREES ACCUMULATE INDEFINITELY AND THE LIFECYCLE BREAKS.\n\n**Step 3: Close MR Bead (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\n⚠️ **VERIFICATION BEFORE CLOSING**: Confirm the work is actually on the merge target:\n```bash\n# Get the commit message/issue from the branch\ngit log origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e --oneline | grep \"\u003cissue-id\u003e\"\n# OR verify the commit SHA is on the target:\ngit branch --contains \u003ccommit-sha\u003e | grep \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\nIf work is NOT on the merge target, DO NOT close the MR bead. Investigate first.\n\n```bash\nbd close \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e --reason \"Merged to \u003cmerge-target\u003e at $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\"\n```\n\nThe MR bead ID was in the MERGE_READY message or find via:\n```bash\nbd list --type=merge-request --status=open | grep \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\n```\n\n**VALIDATION**: The MR bead's source_issue should be a valid bead ID (gt-xxxxx),\nnot a branch name. If source_issue contains a branch name, flag for investigation.\n\n**Step 4: Archive the MERGE_READY mail (REQUIRED)**\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmerge-ready-message-id\u003e\n```\nThe message ID was tracked when you processed inbox-check.\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup (only after Steps 2-4 confirmed)**\n```bash\ngit branch -d temp\n```\n\ndelete_merged_branches (see config above) controls whether to delete the remote source branch.\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"true\":\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete \u003cpolecat-branch\u003e\n```\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"false\": Leave the remote branch intact.\n\n**VERIFICATION GATE**: You CANNOT proceed to loop-check without:\n- [x] MERGED mail sent to witness\n- [x] MR bead closed\n- [x] MERGE_READY mail archived\n\nIf you skipped notifications or archiving, GO BACK AND DO THEM NOW.\n\nTarget branch has moved.

WITHOUT THIS NOTIFICATION,\nPOLECAT WORKTREES ACCUMULATE INDEFINITELY AND THE LIFECYCLE BREAKS.\n\n**Step 3: Close MR Bead (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\n⚠️ **VERIFICATION BEFORE CLOSING**: Confirm the work is actually on the merge target:\n```bash\n# Get the commit message/issue from the branch\ngit log origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e --oneline | grep \"\u003cissue-id\u003e\"\n# OR verify the commit SHA is on the target:\ngit branch --contains \u003ccommit-sha\u003e | grep \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\nIf work is NOT on the merge target, DO NOT close the MR bead. Investigate first.\n\n```bash\nbd close \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e --reason \"Merged to \u003cmerge-target\u003e at $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\"\n```\n\nThe MR bead ID was in the MERGE_READY message or find via:\n```bash\nbd list --type=merge-request --status=open | grep \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\n```\n\n**VALIDATION**: The MR bead's source_issue should be a valid bead ID (gt-xxxxx),\nnot a branch name. If source_issue contains a branch name, flag for investigation.\n\n**Step 4: Archive the MERGE_READY mail (REQUIRED)**\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmerge-ready-message-id\u003e\n```\nThe message ID was tracked when you processed inbox-check.\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup (only after Steps 2-4 confirmed)**\n```bash\ngit branch -d temp\n```\n\ndelete_merged_branches (see config above) controls whether to delete the remote source branch.\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"true\":\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete \u003cpolecat-branch\u003e\n```\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"false\": Leave the remote branch intact.\n\n**VERIFICATION GATE**: You CANNOT proceed to loop-check without:\n- [x] MERGED mail sent to witness\n- [x] MR bead closed\n- [x] MERGE_READY mail archived\n\nIf you skipped notifications or archiving, GO BACK AND DO THEM NOW.\n\nTarget branch has moved.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:31:58Z","updated_at":"2026-02-19T15:32:39Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T15:32:39Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-iti6","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-gggf","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:31:58Z","created_by":"gastown/witness","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-iti6","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-nwbs","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:31:58Z","created_by":"gastown/witness","metadata":"{}"}],"ephemeral":true,"work_type":"mutex"}

If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD \\\n  --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log origin/main..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `tmux has-session -t =gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Use the signals from context-check to decide.\n\n**If you decide to continue patrolling:**\n\nResolve your agent bead ID for this patrol cycle. You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Subscribes to `bd activity --follow` (beads activity feed)\n2. Returns IMMEDIATELY when any beads activity occurs (e.g., MR submission)\n3. If no activity, times out with exponential backoff:\n   - First timeout: 30s\n   - Second timeout: 60s\n   - Third timeout: 120s\n   - ...capped at 5 minutes max\n4.

Use the signals from context-check to decide.\n\n**If you decide to continue patrolling:**\n\nResolve your agent bead ID for this patrol cycle. You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Subscribes to `bd activity --follow` (beads activity feed)\n2. Returns IMMEDIATELY when any beads activity occurs (e.g., MR submission)\n3. If no activity, times out with exponential backoff:\n   - First timeout: 30s\n   - Second timeout: 60s\n   - Third timeout: 120s\n   - ...capped at 5 minutes max\n4.

Continue to next patrol cycle\n(the longer backoff will apply next time).\n\nAfter await-signal returns (either by signal or timeout):\n1. **Re-assess session health** (check RSS, context, age again — conditions change)\n2.

{"id":"gt-wisp-zuox","title":"Burn and respawn or loop","description":"End of patrol cycle decision. Use the signals from context-check to decide.\n\n**If you decide to continue patrolling:**\n\nResolve your agent bead ID for this patrol cycle. You MUST replace `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` below with your actual rig name (e.g., `beads`, `town`) before running:\n```bash\nbd list --type=agent --desc-contains=\"role_type: refinery\" --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.status != \"closed\") | select(.description | test(\"(?m)^\\s*rig: \u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e\\s*$\")) | .id'\n```\nThis must return exactly one bead ID. If it returns zero results, STOP and report an error — verify you substituted `\u003cYOUR_RIG\u003e` correctly. If it returns multiple results, STOP and report an error — manual disambiguation is required. Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for MQ activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Subscribes to `bd activity --follow` (beads activity feed)\n2. Returns IMMEDIATELY when any beads activity occurs (e.g., MR submission)\n3. If no activity, times out with exponential backoff:\n   - First timeout: 30s\n   - Second timeout: 60s\n   - Third timeout: 120s\n   - ...capped at 5 minutes max\n4. Tracks `idle:N` label on your agent bead for backoff state\n\n**On signal received** (activity detected):\nReset the idle counter and start next patrol cycle:\n```bash\ngt agent state YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --set idle=0\n```\n\n**On timeout** (no activity):\nThe idle counter was auto-incremented. Continue to next patrol cycle\n(the longer backoff will apply next time).\n\nAfter await-signal returns (either by signal or timeout):\n1. **Re-assess session health** (check RSS, context, age again — conditions change)\n2. Squash the current wisp:\n```bash\ngt mol squash --jitter 10s --summary \"\u003cpatrol-summary\u003e\"\n```\n3. Create and hook a new patrol wisp:\n```bash\nNEW_WISP=$(bd mol wisp mol-refinery-patrol --json | jq -r '.new_epic_id')\nbd update \"$NEW_WISP\" --status=hooked --assignee=\u003crig\u003e/refinery\n```\n4. Continue executing from the inbox-check step of the new wisp\n\n**If you decide to hand off:**\n\nSquash wisp with summary digest, then use `gt handoff` for clean session transition:\n\n```bash\ngt handoff -s \"Patrol complete\" -m \"Merged X branches, Y tests passed.\nQueue: empty/N remaining\nRSS: X MB, Session age: Xh\nNext: [any notes for successor]\"\n```\n\n`gt handoff` sends handoff mail to yourself, respawns with a fresh Claude instance,\nSessionStart hook runs gt prime, and your successor picks up from the hook.\n\n**DO NOT just exit.** Always use `gt handoff` for proper lifecycle.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Never sleep-poll manually (e.g., `sleep 30 \u0026\u0026 bd list`).\nAlways use `gt mol step await-signal` — it's event-driven and tracks backoff state.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:24:36Z","updated_at":"2026-02-19T15:31:02Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T15:31:02Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-zuox","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-5nby","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:24:36Z","created_by":"refinery","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"gt-wisp-zuox","depends_on_id":"gt-wisp-rkqn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-19T15:24:36Z","created_by":"refinery","metadata":"{}"}],"ephemeral":true,"work_type":"mutex"}
